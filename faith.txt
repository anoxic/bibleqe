By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, 
so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.
By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did.
By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings.
And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead.
