The web interface is available at http://bibleqe.com. The CLI is detailed below.


CLI Usage:

IMPLEMENTED ARGUMENTS

Arguments not starting in : are used as search terms (in an AND search)

<term>|<term> executes an OR search

<term*> (any term with an *) - wildcard search

/<regex>/ for a regular expression search

:page <num> sets which page number to view (default = 1)

:limit <num> sets how many results per page (default = 10)

:all will display all results

:show (on by default) show result text

:list list references

:text <version> Change text  (by version abbreviation)


UNIMPLEMENTED ARGUMENTS
