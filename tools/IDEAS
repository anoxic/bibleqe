Should consider using a modified Wharton Text Format, as http://www.bibleprotector.com/WHARTON_PCE.txt

Consider:

A. It will be more human readable, with no need of:
   * A delimeter
   * Special characters to mark comments, headings, and quotes (!, #, >)
B. Any line not starting with a URL (for example 'Ge' for Genesis) will be considered:
     A TITLE IF ALL UPPERCASE
     A note if contains lowercase
     3 (better) an indecated note (with the other number marked somewhere in the text)
C. If not directly adjecent to a line starting with a URL it will be ignored as a comment
     For example, a line with blanks above and below.
D. Already takes care of a name, abbreviated name, and URL for the book


Consider:
