TODO

☒ collect milestones for each release
☒ add tags at those release points
☒ figure out the mental model of the query flow
    and how to organize the source into that instead
    of the current confusing classes structure

☒ Move methods from Verse into Result

☐ Update README (new file structure, other things)


ROADMAP

Version 0.1
☒ Basic indexing and lookup

Version 0.2
☒ Basic web interface thrown together with sinatra,sass,haml

Version 0.3
☒ More useful help / usage page
☐ Reformed into a more lightweight terminal and rack app
☐ Fewer dependencies
☐ Limit regex to only .* and .?
☐ Fetch chapters and verses
☐ Fetch verse ranges
☐ Pagination
☐ Small mobile optimizations

Version 0.4
☐ Reworked program structure intended to be smaller with a clearer structure
  ☐ Move Search and querying code from Parse, Search, and Result.
    Should use only four classes (index,text,query,result)
      |
      | indexes,texts = Index.load_all!,Text.load_all!
      | terms,options = Query.parse(q) 
      | result = Query.process(terms, indexes[options[:text]])
      | render result.fetch(texts[options[:text]])
      |
  ☐ Query and result maybe should be modules
  ☐ Only Text and Indexer should ever look at ReferencePattern


Version 0.5
☐ Use superset of Wharton text format
☐ Display info about source of Bible text

Possible Future Updates
☐ Re-work indexes to have a different relationship to stop-words, and word prefix/suffixes
☐ Maybe scanf will provide better lookup than current loop+regex method
☐ Add a "similar words" feature that ignores word prefixes and suffixes
☐ Possibly C implementation of indexer and query engine
☐ Include apocrypha
☐ Add more versions: RNKJV, The Scriptures, Mechon-Mamre, NASB, NIV (may have to keep texts in a private repository)
☐ Add KJV translators notes
☐ Use a safer regex engine
☐ Possibly create native desktop apps 
☐ Web API inteface with json or xml output
☐ Hebrew-language web interface
☐ Integrate strongs numbers into KJV and NIV versions
☐ Use strongs numbers to lookup source words or recommend similar words
